        <p>Hello! I'm Ilse, a Venezuelan living in Florida. I'm currently studying Digital Broadcast Production at Valencia College, where I have been learning the foundations of visual storytelling through tools like Digital Photography, Photoshop, and Video Production using Premier Pro.
        </p>
        <p>This journey has deepened my love for creating content that reflects who I am and what moves me. Through content creation I aim to capture movement, emotion and culture in ways that feel authentic and inspiring.</p>
        
        <p>This is just the beginning, and I'm excited to keep growing, sharing and creating along the way.</p>
        <br>
